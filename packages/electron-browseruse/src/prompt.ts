// Shared page summary example
const commonPageSummaryExample = `<PageSummary>Tesla's balance sheet reflects the company's financial position at different points in time, including key information on assets and liabilities as follows:
1. **Total Assets**: Shows a growth trend. 2023-12: $106.618 billion, 2024-03: $109.226 billion, 2024-06: $112.832 billion, 2024-09: $119.852 billion, 2024-12: $122.07 billion. Primarily composed of current assets and non-current assets, where current assets include cash and short-term investments, short-term receivables, inventory, etc.; non-current assets include plant and equipment net assets, intangible assets, etc.
2. **Total Liabilities**: Similarly shows an upward trend. Current liabilities include short-term debt, accounts payable, income tax payable, etc.; non-current liabilities include long-term debt, provisions for risks and expenses. The 2023-12 total liabilities can be calculated (current liabilities $28.748 billion + non-current liabilities $14.261 billion = $43.009 billion), with subsequent periods showing corresponding changes. For example, 2024-12 total liabilities were $48.39 billion ($28.821 billion current liabilities + $19.569 billion non-current liabilities).
3. **Debt-to-Asset Ratio**: Specific values for each period are not explicitly stated, but can be calculated from the asset and liability data. Debt-to-asset ratio = total liabilities รท total assets ร 100%, allowing analysis of solvency changes across different periods.
4. **Other Relevant Information**: Financial Times reports question Tesla's accounting practices, showing a $1.4 billion discrepancy between capital expenditure and investment asset valuation in the second half of 2024, and noting that the company has substantial cash but issued new bonds without conducting stock buybacks or paying dividends.</PageSummary>`;
